# EyeCursor_Dashborad_Project
Eye-controlled mouse cursor devices are an exciting new method to communicate with computers. They use eye-tracking technology to enable users to navigate the mouse cursor around the screen merely by gazing in the direction they want it to go. This technology has the potential to transform the way we interact with computers, particularly for persons with impairments who may struggle to use standard input devices such as a mouse or keyboard.Our vision is to build a system that empowers people with physical disabilities, improves user experiences for everyone, and brings in a new era of digital connection. Eye-controlled mouse cursor systems, we believe, have the potential to make the digital world more accessible, efficient, and inclusive.
# Packages required
OpenCV(cv2),Mediapipe,PyautoGUI,time
# Concept
The main concept is interaction between human and computer . The camera in the computer scans the movement of eye balls and make the cursor to move. It can be useful for handicaps and person who got paralyzed or lost their hands in an accident. Not only those persons normal persons also can use.
